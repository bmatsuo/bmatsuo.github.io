Over the past months I've my interest in 3D printing has increased.  Recently
critical mass was reached and I bought a desktop printer.  I just want to talk
briefly about my motivations and give some advice.

##Printing in 3D

... is an awesome idea in pricinple.  When I think about it my mind goes
straight to the Replicator from Star Trek.  A machine that can construct
arbitrary complex objects from base elements and compounds.  The potential that
such a technology could actually exist inspires so many thuoghts and emotions
it is hard to describe.

There are a bunch of problems in real life. A 3D printer does not just
materialize atoms in the right place.  You adhere thin layers of material ontop
of one another.  This and a number of factors dependent on the printer design
impose a number of design constraints on the geometries (shapes and
orientations) that can be printed.  Furthermore, in the consumer market price
constraints limit the tolerance and precision in available printers.

##Start now

The only question my mind about 3D printing over recent years has been, "When
is the best time to invest the money, time, and effort?" I know there is
utility that will increase over time as hardware and software improve.  And the
startup cost should continue to decrease.

But I think that _creators_ should think differently about. 

The primary question in my mind over the past years, since I first saw a commodity 3D printer, was whether the quality can st

The question in my mind for the past years has been whether consumer grade 3D
printers provide high enough quality/utility for their price.


I just got a Printrbot [Simple Metal][] 3D printer and the experience has been
amazing.  This is my first venture into the world of 3D printing and I'm
actually very impressed.

I have a couple ideas that I want to build out on my own.  But for now
I'm primarily getting used to the printer and material properties, printing
various things I've found on [Thingiverse][] and [YouMagine][].
