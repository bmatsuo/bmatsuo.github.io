Recently, reports of click-jacking attacks spread across the internet. These
attacks always ended with one takeaway; use the X-Frame-Options: DENY header on
your website. But, Some products are centered around iframes. So quastion then

beyond iframes. SAAS on the web is all about deploying assets and serving
requests across domains. This is the general problem of protected resource usage.
